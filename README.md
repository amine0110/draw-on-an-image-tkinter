# Draw on an image tkinter
To do this project, we need to work with Tkinter, because the best way to draw on an image is to create a `Tkinter` canvas, we put the image in the canvas then the drawing will be easier.
This draw will be using the `mouse`, so it will be a random shape.

## The steps
- Create the application
- Create a canvas
- Put an image on the canvas
- Draw lines on the canvas using the mouse

To create an empty GUI, there are only 3 lines of code, and here are:

```Python
from tkinter import *
app = Tk()
app.mainloop()
```
